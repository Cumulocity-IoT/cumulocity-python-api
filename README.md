# cumulocity-python-api

## Installation
After downloading the project, install the requirements by running 

```
cd c8y-python-api
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It is recommended to do this in a virtual environment instead of installing the requirements globally:

```
cd c8y-python-api
python3 -m venv c8y
source c8y/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the samples in the *test* folder, add the *main* folder to your PYTHONPATH:

```
export PYTHONPATH=<<path to project>>/c8y-python-api/main
```
