# cumulocity-python-api

This project is a Python client for the Cumulocity REST API to make it easier to develop programs, scripts, device agents or microservices in Python.

## Installation
After downloading the project, install the requirements by running 

```
cd cumulocity-python-api
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It is recommended to do this in a virtual environment instead of installing the requirements globally:

```
cd cumulocity-python-api
python3 -m venv c8y
source c8y/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the samples in the *sample* folder, add the *c8y_api* folder to your PYTHONPATH:

```
export PYTHONPATH=<<path to project>>/c8y-python-api/main
```
